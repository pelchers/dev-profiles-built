We've implemented the initial authentication and profile page structure in our dev profiles app. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's working and what's pending:

1. Authentication Context:
- Fixed AuthContext.tsx to properly handle login/logout
- Updated token handling to use accessToken from the backend
- Removed credentials:include since we're using token-based auth
- Set up proper error handling and loading states
- Initial fetchProfile implementation (but needs database integration)

2. Navigation & Routes:
- Profile page is now properly protected with ProtectedRoute component
- Login redirects to /profile instead of /dashboard
- Profile link appears in both hamburger menu and user dropdown when authenticated
- MainLayout properly includes Navbar with auth-aware UI

3. User Types & Interfaces:
- Comprehensive User interface with proper types for both Developer and Company profiles
- UserType enum (DEVELOPER/COMPANY)
- DevFocus enum for specializations
- Role enum (USER/ADMIN)
- Proper typing for GitHub integration fields
- All necessary fields for GitHub sync defined in types

4. Login Flow:
- Working login form with proper validation
- Error handling and loading states
- Proper autocomplete attributes on form fields
- Secure password handling
- Ready for database integration

5. Profile Page Current State:
Basic Structure Implemented:
- Component layout with sections (Basic Info, Focus & Skills, Social & Links, etc.)
- Field definitions for all profile types
- Conditional rendering based on user type (Developer/Company)
- UI components for different field types (text, textarea, tags, JSON, etc.)

Pending Database Integration:
- Currently not connected to actual database data
- Display-only implementation without edit functionality
- GitHub fields defined but not actively syncing
- Need to implement actual data persistence

6. GitHub Integration Structure:
Defined but Not Active:
- Fields for GitHub data prepared in User interface
- Basic sync button UI implemented
- Placeholder for GitHub profile section
- Types defined for all GitHub fields

Pending GitHub Features:
- Auto-sync on signup not implemented yet
- 24-hour cycle sync not set up
- Manual sync button needs backend connection
- GitHub stats display components need implementation

7. Profile Editing Flow (To Be Implemented):
- Edit mode toggle needs to be connected
- Form submission handlers need database integration
- Field validation needs to be implemented
- Real-time preview for edits
- Proper error handling for failed updates
- Optimistic updates for better UX

8. Data Flow Requirements (Pending):
- Initial profile load from database
- Save profile changes to database
- GitHub webhook integration
- Periodic GitHub data refresh
- Cache management for GitHub data
- Error handling for failed GitHub syncs

The basic structure is in place, but the actual data flow is not yet implemented. We need to:

1. Connect profile display to actual database data
2. Implement profile editing functionality:
   - Enable edit mode
   - Handle form submissions
   - Validate fields
   - Save to database
   - Handle errors

3. Set up GitHub integration:
   - Implement auto-sync on signup
   - Set up 24-hour sync cycle
   - Handle manual sync requests
   - Store and update GitHub data
   - Display GitHub stats and info

4. Add data persistence layers:
   - Database operations for profile updates
   - GitHub API integration
   - Caching layer for GitHub data
   - Error recovery mechanisms

5. Implement company-specific features:
   - Company profile fields
   - Team member management
   - Job posting functionality
   - Company verification process

All changes are committed and our git branches (main, project-setup, project-setup-plus) are in sync, with a new working-boiler-2 branch ready for implementing these pending features.

Next immediate steps:
1. Connect profile page to database
2. Implement basic CRUD operations
3. Set up GitHub integration flow
4. Add edit functionality
5. Implement auto-sync features

This gives us a clear picture of what's built (structure and types) versus what needs to be implemented (actual functionality and data flow).
