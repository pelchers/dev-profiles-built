lets push before switching to a new project-setup branch which we can use to set up the projec  via those instructions, which we can push to that branch once complete and then merge all those updates into the main branch at the end... can we do this 
---
-----------------

Absolutely, that's a great workflow approach. Here are the commands to push your current changes, create a new project-setup branch, and prepare for the setup implementation:

```bash
# First, make sure all current changes are committed to main
git add .
git commit -m "Add project setup documentation and references"
git push origin main

# Create and switch to a new project-setup branch
git checkout -b project-setup

# Now you can follow the setup instructions on this branch
# (After completing setup)
git add .
git commit -m "Implement complete project structure and initial setup"
git push origin project-setup

# Once ready to merge back to main (do this after setup is complete)
git checkout main
git merge project-setup
git push origin main
```

This workflow allows you to:
1. Keep a clean main branch
2. Implement all setup steps in an isolated environment
3. Review the changes before merging
4. Have a clear project history showing the setup phase

Would you like to proceed with creating the project-setup branch now?
