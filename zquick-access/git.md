git init
git remote remove origin 2>$null
git remote add origin https://github.com/pelchers/dev-profiles-built.git
git checkout -b main



git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

--------------------

To check your current git branch, run:

```powershell
git branch
```

or, for a concise one-line status:

```powershell
git status
```

This will show your current branch (with a `*` next to it) and any changes you have staged or unstaged.

--------------------

You can push your current work to a different branch on the remote **without checking it out locally** by specifying the source and destination in your `git push` command:

```powershell
git push origin HEAD:target-branch-name
```

- `HEAD` refers to your current local branch/commit.
- `target-branch-name` is the name of the branch you want to push to on the remote (it will be created if it doesnâ€™t exist).

**Example:**  
If you want to push your current work to a remote branch called `feature/new-ui`:

```powershell
git push origin HEAD:feature/new-ui
```

This will push your current branchâ€™s state to the `feature/new-ui` branch on GitHub, without switching branches locally.

--------------------

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for your workflow:

---

## 1. **Push your current branch to the remote**

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
*(This pushes to the branch you are currently on.)*

---

## 2. **Switch to `main`**

```powershell
git checkout main
```

---

## 3. **Merge your working branch into `main`**

Assuming your working branch is called `feature/my-branch` (replace with your actual branch name):

```powershell
git merge feature/my-branch
```

---

## 4. **Push `main` to the remote**

```powershell
git push
```

---

## 5. **Switch back to your working branch**

```powershell
git checkout feature/my-branch
```

---

## **All Together (Copy-Paste Example)**

Replace `feature/my-branch` with your actual branch name:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-branch
git push
git checkout feature/my-branch
```

---

Let me know if you want a version that handles merge conflicts, or if you want to do this with rebase instead of merge!

This workflow saves your changes to your current feature branch, pushes them to the remote, then switches to the `main` branch to merge in your feature branchâ€™s changes and pushes the updated `main` to the remote. Finally, it switches you back to your feature branch so you can continue working, ensuring both your feature branch and `main` are up to date with your latest work.

Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a super easy-to-read, broken-up version:

- **Save your changes** to your current branch and push them online.
- **Switch to `main`** (the main branch of your project).
- **Merge in your feature branch** so `main` has your latest work.
- **Push `main`** to the remote so everyone has the latest version.
- **Switch back** to your feature branch to keep working.

--------------------

Hereâ€™s exactly what to run for your current setup (your working branch is `project-setup` and your main branch is `main`):

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
git checkout main
git merge project-setup
git push
git checkout project-setup
```

**What this does:**
- Saves and pushes your changes on `project-setup`
- Switches to `main` and merges in your work
- Pushes the updated `main`
- Switches you back to `project-setup` to keep working

--------------------

To create and switch to a new local branch (different from `main` or your current branch), use:

```powershell
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

- Replace `new-branch-name` with whatever you want to call your new branch.

This will:
- Create the new branch from your current branch (often `main` or wherever you are)
- Switch you to that new branch immediately

---

### Example

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

---

### About the "Super Easy Version"

Yes, the "super easy version" is better for most workflows because:
- Itâ€™s explicit (you always know which branch youâ€™re working with)
- It works even if the remote branch doesnâ€™t exist yet
- Itâ€™s easy to copy, paste, and adapt for any branch

---

**Summary:**  
## 1. Use `git checkout -b new-branch-name` to start a new branch. ##
## 2. Use the "super easy version" flow to push, merge, and keep everything in sync. ##

Let me know if you want a full copy-paste flow for starting a new branch and then pushing/merging!

----------

Exactly!  
The reason it didnâ€™t work the first time is because the remote branch (`project-setup`) didnâ€™t exist yet, and you hadnâ€™t set the upstream link.  
After you set the upstream, everything works smoothly.

---

## ðŸ†• All-in-One Command Flow:  
**Push both your working branch and main to remote, creating the remote branch if needed**

Hereâ€™s a robust workflow you can use every time:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
git checkout main
git merge $(git branch --show-current)
git push
git checkout -
```

### **How this works:**
- `git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)`  
  Pushes your current branch to the remote and sets the upstream if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- `git checkout main`  
  Switches to main.
- `git merge $(git branch --show-current)`  
  Merges your working branch into main.  
  *(If you want to always merge a specific branch, replace `$(git branch --show-current)` with the branch name.)*
- `git push`  
  Pushes main to the remote.
- `git checkout -`  
  Switches you back to your previous branch (your working branch).

---

### **Super Easy Version (with explicit branch name):**

Replace `feature/my-branch` with your branch name:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/my-branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-branch
git push
git checkout feature/my-branch
```

---

**This flow will:**
- Always create the remote branch if it doesnâ€™t exist
- Keep both your working branch and main up to date locally and remotely
- Return you to your working branch so you can keep coding

Let me know if you want a version with extra safety checks or for handling merge conflicts!

--------------------

### 1. Create and switch to a new branch called `project-setup-plus`  
```powershell
git checkout -b project-setup-plus
```
- make new branch and move to it so you can start working there

---

### 2. Push the new branch to GitHub and set upstream  
```powershell
git push --set-upstream origin project-setup-plus
```
- send your new branch to GitHub and link it so future pushes are easy
