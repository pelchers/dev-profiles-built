You're right, I'm adding unnecessary steps. Let me simplify the workflow:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add comprehensive Prisma + PostgreSQL + Auth setup guide"

# Push to the current working branch (project-setup-plus)
git push origin project-setup-plus

# Update main with these changes
git checkout main
git merge project-setup-plus
git push origin main

# Update project-setup branch with these changes
git checkout project-setup
git merge project-setup-plus
git push origin project-setup

# Switch back to your working branch
git checkout project-setup-plus
```




# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Contact form, backend fixes, and boilerplate setup"

# Push to the current working branch (project-setup-plus)
git push origin project-setup-plus

# Update main with these changes
git checkout main
git merge project-setup-plus
git push origin main

# Update project-setup branch with these changes
git checkout project-setup
git merge project-setup-plus
git push origin project-setup

# Create and push to the new branch working-boiler-1 from project-setup
git checkout -b working-boiler-1
git push origin working-boiler-1

# Switch back to your working branch
git checkout project-setup-plus





```bash
# Stage all changes - this tells Git to include all modified files in the next commit
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message - this creates a snapshot of the staged changes with a message explaining what was done
git commit -m "Add comprehensive Prisma + PostgreSQL + Auth setup guide"

# Push to the current working branch - this uploads your committed changes to the remote repository, specifically to your current branch
git push origin project-setup-plus

# Update main with these changes
git checkout main              # Switch to the main branch
git merge project-setup-plus   # Merge your work from project-setup-plus into main
git push origin main           # Upload the merged changes to the remote main branch

# Update project-setup branch with these changes
git checkout project-setup     # Switch to the project-setup branch
git merge project-setup-plus   # Merge your work from project-setup-plus into project-setup
git push origin project-setup  # Upload the merged changes to the remote project-setup branch

# Switch back to your working branch - this returns you to your original branch so you can continue working
git checkout project-setup-plus
```

Each command performs a specific function in the workflow:
1. `git add .` - Prepares all modified files for committing
2. `git commit` - Creates a permanent snapshot of your changes with documentation
3. `git push` - Uploads your changes to the specified remote branch
4. `git checkout` - Switches between branches
5. `git merge` - Combines changes from one branch into another

This process ensures your comprehensive guide is saved in your working branch and then propagated to both the main and project-setup branches, keeping everything in sync.





# 1. First, add and commit changes to the current project-setup-plus branch
git add .
git commit -m "Fix profile flow to connect with database and auth flow"
git push origin project-setup-plus

# 2. Create and push to a new branch called working-database-auth-profile-flow-boiler-3-no-github-automation
git checkout -b "working-database-auth-profile-flow-boiler-3-no-github-automation"
git push -u origin "working-database-auth-profile-flow-boiler-3-no-github-automation"

# 3. Create and push to a new branch called working-branch-1
git checkout -b working-branch-1
git push -u origin working-branch-1
