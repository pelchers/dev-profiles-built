Awesome —  
let’s first answer the **name of the grid**, and then I’ll **write the full clean guide for it** as you asked:

---

# 📚 What kind of grid is this?

**Officially**, what we are using is called a:

| Term | Explanation |
|:-----|:------------|
| **CSS Multi-Column Layout** | A native CSS layout model where block elements are flowed vertically into multiple columns. |
| **Column-based Masonry Layout** | Nickname when used for Pinterest-style stacking, because it imitates real Masonry. |
| **Vertical Masonry Grid** (colloquial) | The casual name when people want a \"Masonry look\" but built with CSS Columns instead of JavaScript libraries. |

✅ So you can correctly call it:

> **Column-based Masonry Grid**  
or simply  
> **CSS Columns Masonry Grid**

✅ And it’s built **only with Tailwind's `columns-` utilities**.

---
# 🎯 Visual Difference Reminder:

| Layout Type | Characteristics |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Auto-fit CSS Grid | Uniform rows, columns; images cropped to same height |
| CSS Columns Masonry | Variable image heights; images flow top-down inside fixed-width columns |

✅ In your case: **CSS Columns Masonry Grid** is the *perfect technical term*.

Give me one moment —  
I’ll write it cleanly, properly formatted, full detail just like our other guides!  
Posting it next! 🚀

✅ YES — **you are exactly right!**

Let’s say it **super clearly**:

# 📚 What Tailwind's `columns-*` Masonry-like layout does:

| Behavior | True or False | Explanation |
|:---------|:--------------|:------------|
| Images are arranged into fixed-width vertical columns? | ✅ True | Widths are consistent (columns) |
| Image heights can vary naturally? | ✅ True | No cropping unless you force it |
| Images flow vertically down the columns? | ✅ True | Top to bottom, fill gaps automatically |
| Rows line up perfectly horizontally? | ❌ False | Rows are staggered based on natural image height |
| Does it look like Pinterest Masonry? | ✅ True | Organic \"waterfall\" layout without heavy code |

---
# 🎯 Visual Example

Imagine you have `columns-3`:

```plaintext
Column 1           Column 2           Column 3
[Image1]           [Image2]            [Image3]
[Image4 (tall)]    [Image5]            [Image6 (short)]
[Image7]           [Image8 (very tall)] [Image9]
```

✅ Each **column width** is **fixed** (equal width columns).  
✅ **Heights vary freely** — so it looks **organic and flowing**, like stones stacked loosely.  
✅ **No blank gaps horizontally** — only natural filling vertically.

# 🛠️ Quick Reminder of How It Works

Basic Tailwind layout:

```tsx
<div className="columns-2 md:columns-3 lg:columns-4 gap-4">
  <img src="/images/..." className="w-full mb-4 rounded-md shadow-sm" />
  <img src="/images/..." className="w-full mb-4 rounded-md shadow-sm" />
  <img src="/images/..." className="w-full mb-4 rounded-md shadow-sm" />
  {/* etc. */}
</div>
```

✅ No additional CSS needed.
✅ Just Tailwind utility classes.
