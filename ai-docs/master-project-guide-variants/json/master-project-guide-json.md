# 📝 Overview: Basic Info and Project Conventions

You are building a **clean, modern marketing-style site** with scalable server operations, using:

✅ Node.js + Express server (serving static Vite frontend build)  
✅ React (modern JSX via Vite)  
✅ TailwindCSS for styling  
✅ React Router for page navigation (SPA behavior)  
✅ Tailwind Automation inside Start Script  
✅ Single Service Hosting on Render.com  
✅ Flows-based organization for features  
✅ Strict 1-1 type matching (frontend ↔ backend)  
✅ Hooks manage frontend API calls directly (optionally separated if complex)
✅ Clear service-controller convention (combine unless complexity demands separation)

# 📅 Local Development vs Production Hosting

| Phase | What Happens |
|:------|:-------------|
| **Development** | Vite Dev Server (frontend), Express (backend APIs) |
| **Production** | Express serves static `/client/dist` + backend APIs |

✅ Single Web Service on Render.
✅ Vite is purely for local dev and building.

---

# 📚 TailwindCSS Automation Setup

TailwindCSS build is embedded into the `start` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "start": "npm run build && node server/server.js"
}
```

✅ Tailwind build automated.
✅ No manual `npm run build:css` needed.

---

# 📧 Frontend vs Backend API Handling

| Layer | Responsibility |
|:------|:---------------|
| Frontend Hooks | Handle fetch calls and state (useComments.ts) |
| Frontend APIs (optional) | Pure fetch logic abstraction (commentsApi.ts) |
| Backend Routes | Define REST endpoints |
| Backend Controllers | Handle API request/response |
| Backend Services (optional) | Contain complex business logic |

✅ Start with Hooks directly calling APIs.
✅ Split into frontend APIs if fetch complexity grows.

---

# 🚦 Frontend and Backend Routing

## Frontend Routing (SPA Navigation)
```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/services" element={<Services />} />
  <Route path="/gallery" element={<Gallery />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
</Routes>
```

✅ User navigates between pages without full page reloads.

## Backend Routing (API Endpoints)
```ts
const commentRoutes = require('./flows/comments/commentRoutes');
app.use('/api/comments', commentRoutes);
```

✅ API endpoints are cleanly separated by flow.

---

# 📈 Types Management (1-1 Match Across Stack)

✅ Each flow defines its types in:
- `/client/src/types/[flow].ts`
- `/server/common/types/[flow].ts`

✅ Must stay synchronized.
✅ Protects frontend-backend API contract.

Even if backend needs extra server-only fields, the **base model must match**.

---

# 📈 Full Example of Single Flow (Now Including Types and API)

```
Frontend
└── CommentSection.tsx (UI)
└── useComments.ts (hook for fetching)
└── commentsApi.ts (optional API abstraction)
└── /types/comment.ts (frontend types)

Backend
└── commentRoutes.ts (defines API routes)
└── commentController.ts (handles API requests)
└── commentService.ts (optional service logic)
└── /common/types/comment.ts (backend types)
└── /json/flows/comments/comments.json (data storage)
```

✅ Modular, predictable, extensible.

---

# 🛠️ Convention: When to Combine or Separate Service Logic

| Situation | Best Practice |
|:----------|:--------------|
| Simple CRUD flows | ✅ Keep logic inside controller |
| Complex rules, external APIs, reuse | ✅ Separate into service file |

✅ Always prefer simplicity until complexity forces separation.

---

# 📄 Purpose of Support Folders

| Folder | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| /media/ | Shared static assets |
| /json/flows/ | Lightweight JSON storage organized by flow |
| /flows/ | Modular grouping for both frontend and backend logic |
| /types/ | Strictly enforced shared typing |

✅ Organizes static, dynamic, and typed data clearly.

---

# 🧩 Steps to Expand From Basic Project to Full Server Ops

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:------|
| 1 | Create `/flows/` in both `/client/src/components/` and `/server/` |
| 2 | Create `/types/` in `/client/src/` and `/server/common/` |
| 3 | Create `/media/` and `/json/flows/` folders at project root |
| 4 | Organize all new features as independent flows |
| 5 | Keep Tailwind/Vite/Render setup the same |

✅ No core disruption — only logical expansions.

# 🔥 New Sections Added for Ultra-Comprehensive Coverage

## 📦 Deployment and Build Conventions
- Always run `npm run build` before pushing for local tests.
- On Render, auto-deploy on push.
- Rebuild Vite frontend and restart server automatically.

## 🔒 Environment Variables Conventions
- Store secrets in `.env` (even if minimal for now).
- Examples:
  - `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`
  - `EMAIL_API_KEY`
- Load with `process.env.*` inside server files.

## ⚡ Error Handling and Validation Conventions
- Use basic 400/500 responses in Controllers.
- Validate required fields inside Controllers before processing.
- Example error pattern:
```ts
if (!pageName || !commentText) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Missing required fields' });
}
```

✅ Protects server from invalid payloads.

## 📚 Comments Flow Storage Conventions
- Each page's comments stored separately: `/json/flows/comments/[pageName].json`
- Comment files sorted by submission time (newest last).
- Comments always contain:
  - pageName
  - fullName
  - topic
  - commentText
  - createdAt
  - commentId (UUID)

✅ Uniform, queryable structure.

# ✨ Final Notes

✅ Professional SPA with React Router.  
✅ Clean API-ready backend.  
✅ Flows-based organization across client/server.  
✅ JSON or database ready.  
✅ Typesafe, predictable, scalable structure.  
✅ Render-compatible single-server hosting.
