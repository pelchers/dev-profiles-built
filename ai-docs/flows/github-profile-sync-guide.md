# 📖 GitHub Profile Sync Flow Guide

## What This File Does
This guide explains how to implement an **automatic GitHub profile sync** for all users with a connected GitHub account. The sync runs on a schedule (e.g., every 12 or 24 hours) and is designed to scale efficiently, even with 10,000+ users.

---

## 🔄 Overview
- **Purpose:** Keep user profiles up-to-date with their latest GitHub data (avatar, bio, followers, etc.)
- **How:** Periodically fetch the latest GitHub user data for all users with a linked GitHub account and update the database.
- **Why:** Ensures profiles reflect current GitHub status, activity, and branding.

---

## 🛠️ Backend Setup
1. **Schema:** Ensure the `User` model has a `githubProfile` JSON field and key GitHub fields (see schema update).
2. **API Integration:** Use the GitHub REST API to fetch user data. Store the full response in `githubProfile` and map key fields for fast access.
3. **Batch Processing:**
   - Query all users with a `githubUsername` or `githubProfile` set.
   - For each user, fetch their GitHub profile and update the DB.
   - Use batching (e.g., 100 users per batch) to avoid rate limits and server overload.

## ⏰ Scheduling the Sync
- **Recommended Frequency:** Every 12 or 24 hours (adjust as needed).
- **How to Schedule:**
  - Use a job scheduler like [`node-cron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) in your backend server.
  - Or, use an external scheduler (e.g., GitHub Actions, Render cron jobs, or a cloud function) to trigger the sync endpoint.
- **Example Approach:**
  - With `node-cron`, schedule a job to run at midnight UTC:
    ```js
    cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', () => { /* run sync logic */ });
    ```
  - For large user bases, consider a queue system (e.g., BullMQ, RabbitMQ) to process users in manageable chunks.

---

## 🚦 Scaling & Best Practices
- **Batch Requests:** Never sync all users at once. Use batches (e.g., 100-500 users per run) to avoid API rate limits and DB spikes.
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect GitHub API rate limits (60/hr unauthenticated, 5,000/hr authenticated). Use a GitHub App or personal access token for higher limits.
- **Error Handling:** Log failures and retry failed syncs in the next cycle.
- **Opt-Out:** Allow users to disconnect GitHub or opt out of auto-sync.
- **Monitoring:** Track sync job duration, errors, and API usage for reliability.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Notes
- **Environment Variables:** Store GitHub API tokens securely in `.env`.
- **Scheduling:** Adjust frequency and batch size based on user count and server capacity.
- **Testing:** Start with a small batch and increase as you monitor performance.

## ✅ Summary
- Add `githubProfile` and key fields to the User model (done)
- Implement a scheduled sync job (node-cron or external)
- Batch process users to avoid overload
- Monitor and adjust as your user base grows

This flow ensures your platform always displays up-to-date GitHub info, scales to thousands of users, and avoids unnecessary server load.
