# üß† Clarification Document: Dev Profiles Platform ‚Äì Core App Mechanics

This file is a **permanent reference** meant to clarify how your Dev Profiles app works under the hood ‚Äî with slow, deep explanations and supporting insights for fetches, APIs, types, schema structure, color logic, and full-stack flow.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Fetches ‚Äì What, Where, and Why

| Concept            | Explanation                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is `fetch()`? | A browser-native way to make HTTP requests. Used in React to send/receive API data.           |
| Usage in app       | Posts, projects, messages, likes, and profile edits all use `fetch()` calls to backend APIs.  |
| Wrapped in hooks   | `useProfile()`, `useProjects()`, `usePosts()` abstract this logic for reusability and clarity |

‚úÖ This keeps component logic clean, enables loading states, and separates data from layout.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Express API Flow ‚Äì Single Server Pattern

In this platform:

* React + Express are served from **one Express server**
* React handles all frontend logic
* Express handles all API logic under `/api/*`

**Example flow:**

```tsx
fetch('/api/projects')
  ‚Üí Express route ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí Prisma ‚Üí Postgres ‚Üí JSON Response ‚Üí React state
```

‚úÖ No domain splitting, no CORS setup, everything is scoped to a single deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Where Types Come From (Frontend & Backend)

| Layer    | Type Source                        | Notes                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend  | `/server/types/*.ts`               | Custom manual types describing data shapes         |
| Frontend | `import` from backend `/types`     | Enables shared models between client + server      |
| Prisma   | Auto-generated types (server-only) | Rich types used only inside DB code (not exported) |

‚úÖ You control API response shape via custom types ‚Äî not tightly bound to Prisma output.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Prisma Schema Philosophy

| Principle           | Behavior                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flat when possible  | No unnecessary subtables unless relational filtering is needed           |
| All fields optional | Minimize deploy/validation friction                                      |
| Array/JSON usage    | Use `String[]` and `Json` for tags, stack, contributors, preferences     |
| Strong relations    | Likes, watches, messages, posts, projects tied to `userId` for filtering |

‚úÖ Makes the schema comprehensive yet easy to query and maintain.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Color System Integration (Optional but Flexible)

* All styling color logic is defined client-side via `colorLookup.ts`
* Tag colors use base colors or subcategory overrides
* Keywords in bios/posts are highlighted via shared lookup maps
* TagColor DB model can be added to sync admin-defined styling

‚úÖ You can opt-in per page/component. It‚Äôs modular, non-breaking, and works with both light and dark mode.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Root-Level Structure Clarifications

| File                 | Purpose                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vite.config.ts`     | Builds React to `/public` folder for Express to serve                  |
| `server/app.ts`      | Express server serving both React + API                                |
| `main.tsx`           | React entrypoint, sets up BrowserRouter + pageId routing               |
| `src/pages/Page.tsx` | Dynamically loads comments, Q\&A, profile, etc. based on `pageId` prop |
| `.env`               | Sets `DATABASE_URL` and feature toggles                                |

‚úÖ You can follow the app logic linearly from browser ‚Üí React ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí API ‚Üí Prisma ‚Üí Postgres.

## ‚úÖ 7. Clarifying Likes, Watches, Messaging

| Feature   | How It Works                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Likes     | Stored via `Like` model with `userId` and `postId` (deduplicated)  |
| Watches   | `Watch` model links `userId` to `projectId`                        |
| Messaging | `Message` model stores senderId, recipientId, content, read status |

‚úÖ All support querying in both directions: ‚Äúmy likes,‚Äù ‚Äúwatched projects,‚Äù ‚Äúmessages to me.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Project + Post Routing

* Routes are defined via `react-router-dom` in `main.tsx`
* `/profile/:id`, `/post/:id`, `/project/:id`, etc. are mapped explicitly
* Dynamic routing is handled via param parsing + props

‚úÖ Works in both development and production without needing Next.js or custom servers.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. What Happens on `npm run build`

| Action             | Effect                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vite build`       | Compiles React into static HTML/JS/CSS                               |
| `express.static()` | Serves those files on page visit                                     |
| `/api/*` routes    | Still routed to backend Express API (not affected by frontend build) |

‚úÖ Keeps frontend snappy and API flexible. You host only the final output.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Bonus Clarifications

* You can toggle Prisma ‚Üî JSON for local DB simulation
* Color utilities use fallback logic to avoid crashes
* Optional tag themes + field-level styling work without heavy setup
* Postgres schema changes are version-controlled and auto-migrated
* GitHub integration is opt-in and uses lightweight proxy fetches

‚úÖ Everything is optional, modular, and dev-speed optimized.
